COVID-19 India Dashboard
    

An interactive web-based dashboard to visualize and analyze COVID-19 statistics across Indian states and union territories, built using Dash, Plotly, and Pandas.

Overview
The COVID-19 India Dashboard provides an intuitive interface to explore COVID-19 data, including confirmed cases, deaths, recoveries, and active cases. It features interactive visualizations such as choropleth maps, time series plots, pie charts, bar charts, and more, allowing users to analyze data by state and date.

Features
Interactive Visualizations:
Choropleth Map: Displays confirmed cases by state using a color-coded map of India.
Time Series Plot: Tracks confirmed cases, deaths, and recoveries over time for a selected state.
Pie Chart: Shows the distribution of confirmed, recovered, and death cases for a selected state.
Bar Chart: Highlights the top 10 states by confirmed cases.
Active Cases Trend: Visualizes the trend of active cases for a selected state.
Stacked Bar Chart: Compares confirmed, recovered, deaths, and active cases for the top 5 states.
User Inputs:
Select a date using a date picker to view data for a specific day.
Choose a state from a dropdown menu to focus on state-specific statistics.
Summary Cards:
Displays total confirmed cases, deaths, recoveries, and active cases for the selected date.
Responsive Design:
Built with Dash Bootstrap Components for a clean, mobile-friendly layout.
Robust Data Processing:
Handles data cleaning, normalization, and error logging for reliable analysis.
Dataset
The dashboard uses the covid_19_india.csv dataset, which contains daily COVID-19 statistics for Indian states and union territories. The dataset includes the following columns:

Date: Date of the record (DD/MM/YY format).
State/UnionTerritory: Name of the state or union territory.
ConfirmedIndianNational: Confirmed cases among Indian nationals.
ConfirmedForeignNational: Confirmed cases among foreign nationals.
Cured: Number of recovered cases.
Deaths: Number of deaths.
Confirmed: Total confirmed cases.
(Derived) Active: Calculated as Confirmed - Cured - Deaths.
The dataset is preprocessed to clean state names, convert dates, and handle missing values.

The dashboard is accessible locally by default and can be exposed to external networks by setting host='0.0.0.0' in the code.
Interact with the Dashboard:
Select a date using the date picker.
Choose a state from the dropdown menu.
Explore the visualizations and summary cards to analyze COVID-19 statistics.
Screenshots
